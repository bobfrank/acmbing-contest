This is a simple competition management system based on the old one.
In this new version, most of the stuff that was in files is now in a mysql database.
And I changed the backend so it is easier to run and easier to manage, and its in python
instead of bash scripts. Similar to the last version, this one prevents file access, but
this version uses libbox, which is based on the idea of soapbox, but also prevents
fstream file access. And it also prints stuff to stderr so that we can tell the user
that that is why their program failed.
