For xml version:
 1. Copy this folder to your server.
 2. Link somewhere from your httpd to the /web/ folder.
 3. cd to backend/libbox, run make.
 4. copy libbox.so to backend/
 5. copy db-empty.xml to db.xml
 6. set permissions: chmod 777 files backend/db.xml
      (this will change soon, so that db.xml isn't 777)
