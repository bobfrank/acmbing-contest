Things that need doing:

1) Finish administrative interface

Make it so that no shell access is required past setting directories up (which can possibly be done via scp/sftp)

2) Expand submission languages

So far, we have C, C++, and Java.

End goal is to support every language, and have the admin select which they want to be allowed.

Languages left:

Lisp
Haskell
Perl
Ruby
Python
Prolog
C#
